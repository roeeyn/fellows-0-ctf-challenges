# The Intercept

Us members of pod 1.3.3.7 are trying to figure out what
the MLH crew is preparing for the hack week on july 13th.
We have an inside man, Will, that captured one of Swift's
calls with Leah that we think could lead us to the information
we need.


**Obs**: You might want to take a look at [Wireshark](https://ctf101.org/forensics/what-is-wireshark/) for this one.

**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give `intercept.pcap` file to contestants.

**Solution**: Open the `intercept.pcap` file and `follow TCP stream` should show all the information.
**Flag**: `mlh{c0ngr4tz_y0u_g0t_h4ck3d}`
