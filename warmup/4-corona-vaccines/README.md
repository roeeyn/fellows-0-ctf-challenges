# Corona Vaccines

Will is one brave chap. He's not afraid of crowds, sharks,
heights or even dying! But besides all that, there is one
fear Will never got to overcome: needles. Everytime he had
to take a vaccine shot it was the same: he couldn't sleep
the night before, cold sweating and shivering in fear.


When the vaccine for coronavirus comes out, he'll have
to take it, and the thought of that is driving Will crazy
these past few days.


Anyways I'm sure this has nothing to do with the chall, here's
the file.
