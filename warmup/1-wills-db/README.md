# Will's Database

Each employee at MLH has their own database instance
where they store their data, and each of them is
responsible for instanciating the database and handling
everything basically.

During a routine check, Leah noticed something... unusual
about Will's database: it's one text file with ""encrypted""
data.

Since the data is ""encrypted"" I'm sure Will wouldn't mind
if we took a peak at it, right?

**Obs**: `encrypt.py` contains the code used for encrypting
data and adding it to will's database.

**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give `encrypt.py` and `wills-db.txt` to contestants.
