# Disc FORMATing

Will is super excited about the upcoming CTF! In fact, he's so excited
that he decided to format a bunch of brand new SSDs for the MLH crew.
He wants everybody locked and loaded for the challs!

Unfortunately, as all things in life, Will's code is not perfect.

**Hint**: In CTF challs there are usually tips in the description... or in the title



**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give only `format.c` to contestants.
**Flag**: `mlh{let_me_put_zeroos_on_a_disk}`

**Solution**: Solution is coded on `solution.py`:
1. `make && make solve`
2. Get the output of `make solve`
3. Run `python3 solution.py` and feed it the output of `make solve`
