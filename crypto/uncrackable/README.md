# the_most_uncrackable_crypto_ever_yeah_believe_me

Gabriel is always complaining about the current state of the
art cryptography algorithms. He decided to create a flawless
encryption algorithm that nobody will ever crack. People
say his ciphers have "perfect secrecy". Well, mathematically-proven
perfect ciphers can never have security issues can they.

**Hint**: What good is a cipher if you don't hide your keys?

**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give the file `uncrackable.py` for contestants
**Flag**: `mlh{y0u_sh0uld_r34lly_h1d3_y0ur_k3ys_dud3}`
**Solution**: Decode the given ciphertext with `python3 solution.py <CIPHERTEXT>`
