This chall is so simple it doesn't even need a description.

Careful though, simple doesn't mean easy.

**Tip**: What's 128 - 64?



**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give the file `flag.txt` for contestants
**Flag**: `mlh{0h_n0w_1_re4lly_und3rst4nd}`
**Solution**: Simply decode the `txt` file using a base 64 decoder (e.g. `base64 -d < flag.txt`)
