Cryptography is beautiful, isn't it?


**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give the files `encrypt.py` and `secret-flag.png.crypt` to contestants
**Flag**: `mlh{n0nc3_m34n5_numb3r_u53d_ONCE}`

**Solution**:
1. Compile `solution.c`
2. Run the compiled solution inputing `secret-flag.png.crypt` and pipe its output to a file
3. Open the output file with an image viewer
