# String Rayz

Oh would you look at that, looks like our favorite pod 0.5.1 finally fixed the bug with their C code! But you know what they say, fixing a bug always creates another...


**Obs (ctf crew)**: Give file `string_rayz` to contestants

**Flag**: `mlh{f33l1ng_sl33py_h0n3y}`

**Solution**: Use GBD to execute the `print_super_secret_flag_muahaha` function
