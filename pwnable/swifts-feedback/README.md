# Swift's Feedback

During the pod retrospective on last friday one of the mentors
told Swift about this code he needed some INPUT on. The thing is:
this particular mentor doesn't like Git much, so he uploaded
the code on his own server and told Swift to get it using
his credentials. Problem is: Swift is not the best in
remmembering passwords. Can you help him logging in
and getting the code? Perhaps there's a flag on the server
as well...

**Obs:** You do NOT need (or should) use brute forcing techniques
to solve this challenge. Doing so is against the rules.

`nc <server_ip> <server_port>`
Obs (to ctf crew): give the `login.py` file to contestants as well


**Solution**: Simply type `admin_pass`
