# String Rays

We all know pod 0.5.1 is the best pod ever, but the same is not always true regarding their code. One day the other pods were so jealous that they decided to get their revenge.

They remember that Raymond, 0.5.1's mentor, had previously commented on a buggy C code one of the pod's member wrote. He said one could sensitive leak strings from the binary. Help your friends get their revenge.
