# Welcome

Welcome to the first ever MLH Fellowship CTF! We hope that you have fun throughout the week.

There's a few things we need to cover:

## Flags
In case you've never participated in a CTF (Capture The Flag) event before, don't worry! There are
challs (challenges, or problems) for all levels of hackers!

In a CTF all you need to do is, you guessed it, capture flags! Flags are strings (pieces of text)
generally in the format `NAME_OF_CTF{content_of_the_flag}`. For this ctf the format is: **`mlh{flag}`**

## What's next?
The next important thing to do in a CTF is reading the rules. 
Go to the rulez-are-not_fun chall and complete it.
Then, you are off to the races!

Oh and by the way. Here's a free flag for this challenge, you're welcome:
`mlh{IknOwHowtoReadaWelcomeInTro!_~}`
