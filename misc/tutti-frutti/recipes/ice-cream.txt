An old fashioned recipe for tutti-frutti ice cream made with a mix of stone fruit, citrus, and berries.
Author: Lindsey Rose Johnson
Recipe type: Dessert
Serves: 1½ to 2 quarts
Ingredients

    1½-2 cups diced peaches (or nectarines, apricots, cherries)
    ¾ cup granulated white sugar
    12 ounce can evaporated milk
    1 cup heavy cream
    juice of ½ lemon, about 1 Tbsp.
    juice of ½ orange, about 2-3 Tbsp.
    1 tsp. vanilla extract
    ½ tsp. almond extract
    2-2½ cups mashed fruit (I like strawberries and raspberries and a peach mixed with a few tablespoons of sugar)

Instructions

    Puree all of the ingredients except for the mashed berries in a blender. Chill until very cold. Churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. After it is finished churning, transfer to a large freezer-proof container and stir in mashed berries. Serve immediately for soft-serve, or allow to harden in freezer for scoops.
