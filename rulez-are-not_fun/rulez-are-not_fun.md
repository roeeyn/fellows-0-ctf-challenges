# Rules

Rules are not fun, however, here you need to follow them.
They are necessary to keep everyone in a fun environment.

1. Do NOT share flags with other teams. This also applies to individuals outside of your team
2. Do NOT try to bruteforce any of the servers used in the CTF
3. Ask for help when necessary
4. Use appropriate team/individual names
5. Have Fun!

And would you look at that, you got another free flag!
