# Rules

Rules are not fun, however, here you need to follow them.
They are necessary to keep everyone in a fun environment.

1. Don't share flags with other teams. This also applies to individuals outside of your team
2. Ask for help when necessary
3. Use appropriate team/individual names
4. Have Fun!

And would you look at that, you got another free flag!
